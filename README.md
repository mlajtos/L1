# L1: Tensor Studio

[L1: Tensor Studio](https://mlajtos.github.io/L1/latest/) is a live-programming environment for differentiable tensor computations. Think *playground for tensors*!

## ⚠️ Notice

- This project is still under-developed. Any feedback is welcome.

- L1 is for experienced programmers who are transitioning to the field of functional differentiable programming. And also for everybody else. :)

- L1 is NOT a replacement for existing:
    - programming languages – *Python, Scala, ...*
    - runtimes – *Tensorflow, Caffe, PyTorch, ...*
    - IDEs – *VSCode, Jupyter, ...*

    It's something completely different.

- Have fun :)
